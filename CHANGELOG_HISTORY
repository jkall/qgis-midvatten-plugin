        - Section plot: Moved grid lines behind the plots as default
        Version 1.5.13b:
        - Section plot: Fixed bug where os.path.samefile was used but doesn't exist in windows.
        Version 1.5.12b:
        - Stratigraphy: Button for minimizing and maximizing stratigraphy plot (Thanks to Simon O'Connor!)
        - Calculate w-levels: Added checkboxes for more finegrained filtration.
        Version 1.5.11b:
        - Fixed better size for NotFoundQuestion.
        - Custom general report: User defined decimal separator. Upper left table colspan 2 if upper right table is not existing.
        - Fieldlogger import: Fixed a bug where import of depth didn't work. It's now added as an import method instead.
        - Feature to write hydro explanation text for stratigraphy plots (gis.stackexchange.com #272315)
        - Export to spatialite: Fixed bug where new database didn't get old zz-table information.
        - Custom plot: Added function to filter list by word. Added function for dependency between the filters.
        - Section plot: Changed bar line width to 0.5 as default for prettier plots.
        - Section plot: Renamed "customized plots" into Templates. Also changed the user interaction with the templates.
                        The templates them selves are still the same.

        Version 1.5.8b:
        - New utility: List of obsids from selected features.
        - Setting db from a new unsaved project now loads the default settings for midvatten settings dialog.

        - Logger calibration: Fix to only write "uncalibrated" if level_masl is null AND head_cm is NOT NULL. (instead
                              of only check if level_masl is null). The fix is for loggers that only have conductivity
                              or temperature.

                        long string. Saving string in project not working at the moment.
        Version 1.5.4b:
        - Fixed bug in custom_drillreport. Added some internal settings for the obsid-header and skipping empty values.

        - Section plot: "date time f w level" table is splitted using \n only (space and tab doesn't split now)
        - Section plot Added some hidden features to "date time f w level" table:
          * 1901-01-01;Obs1;Obs2 <- Giving obsids after date includes only those obsids for that date (; as separator)
          * 1901-01-01[LABEL] <- Adding a label in brackets after the date uses the given LABEL as label instead of the date

        Version 1.4:
        Most important changes since version 1.3.3 are listed below
        - Database: Table w_qual_field: new column depth replaces column flow_lmp. Column depth is assumed to be the depth from which the measured or sampled water was extracted.

        - General csv import: New feature for importing csv-files or QGis vector layers into any of the database table. This feature removes the need for separate import features for each table. The older import features remain but will be removed in future versions.
        - Diveroffice import: New feature for importing files from diver office (useful for importing many diveroffice files at once instead of only one at the time).
        - Interlab4 import: New feature for importing files using interlab4 format (some Swedish labs use this format).
        - FieldLogger import: New feature for importing files using the Fieldlogger (Android/ios app) output format.
        - Fieldlogger Export: New feature for creating input files for FieldLogger (Android/ios app). Very useful when making field measurements.
        - Calcultate logger w level from logger water head: Many new features to speed ut the process of calculating the logger position (and thus calculating level above sea level from logger head).
        - Custom plot: New features for adjusting the plots (remove mean, apply factor, apply offset) and features only appearing if python pandas is correctly installed (resampling and rolling mean)
        - Custom plot: The built in matplotlib "Edit curves lines and axes parameters" can now be used (clicking _Redraw_ button fixes the axes and lables).
        - plot stratigraphy: Stratigraphy units, plot color and symbols are now editable by the user, so is also the water capacity (by making changes in the tables zz_capacity_plots and zz_stratigraphy_plots)
