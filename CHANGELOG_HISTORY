          * 1901-01-01;Obs1;Obs2 <- Giving obsids after date includes only those obsids for that date (; as separator)
          * 1901-01-01[LABEL] <- Adding a label in brackets after the date uses the given LABEL as label instead of the date

        Version 1.4:
        Most important changes since version 1.3.3 are listed below
        - Database: Table w_qual_field: new column depth replaces column flow_lmp. Column depth is assumed to be the depth from which the measured or sampled water was extracted.

        - Fieldlogger Export: New feature for creating input files for FieldLogger (Android/ios app). Very useful when making field measurements.
        - Calcultate logger w level from logger water head: Many new features to speed ut the process of calculating the logger position (and thus calculating level above sea level from logger head).
        - Custom plot: New features for adjusting the plots (remove mean, apply factor, apply offset) and features only appearing if python pandas is correctly installed (resampling and rolling mean)
        - Custom plot: The built in matplotlib "Edit curves lines and axes parameters" can now be used (clicking _Redraw_ button fixes the axes and lables).
        - plot stratigraphy: Stratigraphy units, plot color and symbols are now editable by the user, so is also the water capacity (by making changes in the tables zz_capacity_plots and zz_stratigraphy_plots)
