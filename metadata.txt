        - New features:
            * New QGIS-symbology to visualize stratigraphy on the map: Utilities / Load stratigraphy symbology to qgis.
            * Utilities / Load data tables to qgis. Loads w_levels_logger, meteo, vlf_data and seismic_data to qgis.

                             This makes it possible to adjust trend without measurements.
        - Fieldlogger import: Fixes python error bug when trying to load stored settings (second try)..

        - Compact water quality report: Bug fixes.
        - Customplot: Bug fix for discontinous plots (#312)

        - Fieldlogger import: Instrument and unit are filled automatically based on last entry for current staff.

        - qgis3-branch moved to master branch. The old master branch for qgis2 is now the qgis2-branch.
        - Fieldlogger export: Adjustments to new locations file format.
        - Interlab4: Fix so that the highest resolution parameter (the one with lowest value) is imported as the original parameter name. Duplicates are given a duplicate suffix.
        - Customplot: Fixes #293. Added checkbox "Regular xaxis interval".
        - Customplot: Fixed tab widget resizing bugs. Restructured settings.
        - Interlab4: Fix so that the highest resolution parameter is imported if there are duplicates.
