changelog=
        Version 1.6.5
        - Database:
            * Added index to w_levels_logger and w_flow for perhaps increased read performance.
            * Added constraint to w_qual_field to not get duplicates when unit is NULL.
            * Plot symbol colors: Changed symbol color for till and clay from yellow to cyan and beige for qt-colors (affecting strat symbology and the old stratigraphy plot).
            * Added support for non-essential data tables s_qual_lab and w_qual_logger. Sql for creating them is in definitions\create_db_extra_data_tables.sql
        - Layer symbology:
            * Added triangle symbol (obs_p_w_lvl_logger) for displaying the existance of logger data for an obsid.
        - LoggerEditor:
            * The features "Calculate logger w level from logger water head" renamed to "Edit water level logger data".
            * New feature to select nodes and altering time series by moving nodes up and down.
            * Changed default search radius to 60 minutes.
            * Period range (now Seleted period) is now inclusive (and nodes inside selected period are marked to visualize this).
        - Stratigraphy symbology:
            * Separated labels and symbols into separate layers.
            * Added layer "Layer texts" for displaying stratigraphy labels on map.
            * The else layer is deactivated by default in layers.
            * Bedrock label as >X when drillstop not like bedrock or equivalent.
            * Added option to filter selected obsids.
            * Reduced shadow opacity to 40% from 70%.
        - Bug fixes:
            * Fixed bug where a missing Postgis table caused a plugin-crash.
        - Gui fixes: Fixed margins for several features after new QGIS versions changed them.
        - Interlab4 import:
            * Fixed bug when closing save metadata without selecting file.
            * Fixed bug when number contained space.
        - Compact water quality report: Fixes bug where "Data from selected obsids in sql table" didn't work.
        - Water quality report: Fixes bug where numeric sorting column couldn't be used.
        - Sectionplot:
            * Fixed bug where obsid was not visible when plotting hydro colors.
            * Fixes bug where obsid label was not written but the bar was plotted.
            * Adjustment for new pandas version (water levels interactive mode).
            * Fixed better error messages when dems are omitted.
        - List of values from selected features: Added checkbox to copy to clipboard.
        - Calculate Aveflow function: Added a pandas variant which keeps the comments.
        - Finddateformat: Added dateformat '%Y%m%d %H:%M'.
