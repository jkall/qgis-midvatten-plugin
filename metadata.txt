changelog=
        Version 1.6.10b4:
        - Better database version comparison.

        Version 1.6.10b3:
        - Probably fixes bug where csv import dialog object seems to be destroyed in the middle of import.
        - Stratsymbology: Added waiting cursor when loading symbology.
        Version 1.6.10b2:
        Fixes #336. (general report fails when water level data missing in postgresql)
        Version 1.6.10b1:
        - Fixes printing bug in Stratigraphy plot.
        Version 1.6.9
        - Fixes bug in XYplot when using Midvattenplugin with Postgresql/Postgis-database.
        Version 1.6.8
        - Fixes #335 (fig.legend giving error message)..
        Version 1.6.7
        - Fixes #335 (fig.legend giving error message)..
        Version 1.6.6
        - Major update of imports in modules to increase code reusability from outside the plugin.
        - Compact w-qual report
            * Made the column report optional to allow reports from w_qual_field.
            * Fixes bug when using aggregation other than concat.
        - Midvattensettings:
            * Fixes bug after closing the settings dialog (fixes #332).
        - Sectionplot:
            * Refactoring.
            * Feature to write layer annotation at the edge or center of the bar.
            * Added option to chose water level base on sql WHERE condition (see tooltip for water level square).
            * Fixes bug where error message was printed too many times.
            * Probably fixes #333 (supporting multiple variations of function "line locate point").
            * Fixes bug where changing water level label in figure options on navigation toolbar didn't change legend text.
            * Fixes bug where layer texts was NULL was written to plot.
            * Fixes bug with interactive water level plot.
        - Export data:
            * Fixes bugs related to the optional tables s_qual_lab and w_qual_logger.
        - FieldloggerExport:
            * Fixes bug where adding layer to QGIS caused an error message.
        - CompactWQualReport:
            * Fixes bug where default table and column not working.
        - CompactWQualReport:
            * Fixes missing column headers.
        Version 1.6.5
        - Database:
            * Added index to w_levels_logger and w_flow for perhaps increased read performance.
            * Added constraint to w_qual_field to not get duplicates when unit is NULL.
            * Plot symbol colors: Changed symbol color for till and clay from yellow to cyan and beige for qt-colors (affecting strat symbology and the old stratigraphy plot).
            * Added support for non-essential data tables s_qual_lab and w_qual_logger. Sql for creating them is in definitions\create_db_extra_data_tables.sql
        - Layer symbology:
            * Added triangle symbol (obs_p_w_lvl_logger) for displaying the existance of logger data for an obsid.
        - LoggerEditor:
            * The features "Calculate logger w level from logger water head" renamed to "Edit water level logger data".
            * New feature to select nodes and altering time series by moving nodes up and down.
            * Changed default search radius to 60 minutes.
            * Period range (now Seleted period) is now inclusive (and nodes inside selected period are marked to visualize this).
        - Stratigraphy symbology:
            * Separated labels and symbols into separate layers.
            * Added layer "Layer texts" for displaying stratigraphy labels on map.
            * The else layer is deactivated by default in layers.
            * Bedrock label as >X when drillstop not like bedrock or equivalent.
            * Added option to filter selected obsids.
            * Reduced shadow opacity to 40 from 70.
        - Bug fixes:

            * Fixed bug when closing save metadata without selecting file.
            * Fixed bug when number contained space.
        - Compact water quality report: Fixes bug where "Data from selected obsids in sql table" didn't work.
        - Water quality report: Fixes bug where numeric sorting column couldn't be used.
        - Sectionplot:
            * Fixed bug where obsid was not visible when plotting hydro colors.
            * Fixes bug where obsid label was not written but the bar was plotted.

            * Fixed better error messages when dems are omitted.
        - List of values from selected features: Added checkbox to copy to clipboard.
        - Calculate Aveflow function: Added a pandas variant which keeps the comments.
